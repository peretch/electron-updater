## Publish new release
1. Create a new release. 
(In this project, we use GitHub releases for pubishing new versions. To make a new release, you have to create a new Release in your project, called `vX.X.X` (for example, `v1.2.5`). This version must match with your `package.json`'s version, in order to run automatically.)
2. `GH_TOKEN={github_credentials} npm run release` (**IMPORTANT:** The github_credentials must have permissions to write and read repo. Remember to change the repository and build information in `package.json`).
3. Then, you will find your new version in `build/dist/mac/yourApp.app` (This is an example for Mac).
